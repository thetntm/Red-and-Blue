The primary font used in this game, "Pixel Operator Bold" is a CC0 Public Domain Font created by Jayvee Enaguas (HarvettFox96).
The Shader "Just Chromatic Abberation" made by jecovier served as a baseline for most shaders in this project, and at some points (such as for the abberation on textbox outlines) is used directly.
All other resources, music, and code for this project were made by me unless I'm forgetting some snippet of code I ripped from a tutorial somewhere.
